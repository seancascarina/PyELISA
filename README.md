# PyELISA: Automation of ELISA data analysis
## Background
- A [recent study](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1427526/full) described a method for automating curve fitting and calculation of endpoint titers for ELISA datasets.
- The R program described in this study is currently unavailable (the authors plan to release an R program in the future).
- Therefore, I wrote a Python script &mdash; PyELISA &mdash; based on their described methods to perform the same type of automated analysis.

## Analysis Techniques
- Absorbance versus antibody dilution is fitted with a sigmoidal curve (4-paramater logistic regression, for 4PL) for each sample.
- Endpoint titer is calculated using parameters derived from the unique sigmoidal curve for each sample.
- The combination of sigmoidal curve fitting with the endpoint titer calculation yields a single, accurate endpoint titer value by taking into account the unique shape of each curve.

## Validation
- Below are figures from the original study ([Dutt *et al.* 2024](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/immunology/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2024.1427526/full)), compared to plots generated by PyELISA for the same data.
